# Deep Learning for Optimal Stopping

This project replicates and extends the deep learning framework of Becker et al. (2020) for solving optimal stopping problems, including:

- Pricing Bermudan max-call options
- Callable multi-barrier reverse convertibles (MBRCs)
- Stopping fractional Brownian motion

We benchmark results against the Longstaff–Schwartz algorithm.
